Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
--> Time complexity will be `O(n)` as need ti go through all nodes.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
-->  `O(1)`

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
--> Time complexity will be `O(n)` as need to go through all nodes.

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
--> Space complexity will be `O(1)` 

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-->  The runtime complexity : `O(n^2)` as nested for loops involved which runs `0 to n`

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
-->  The space complexity : O(n) 

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
--> `O(n)  : runtime: 0.007979154586791992 seconds` two for loops ...not nested.

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
--> O(n)
