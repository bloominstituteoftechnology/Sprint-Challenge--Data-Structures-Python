2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
O(n)
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n)
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n^2) since it is looping through each element of each list to compare to each element of the other
