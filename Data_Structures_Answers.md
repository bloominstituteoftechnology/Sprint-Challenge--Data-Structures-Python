Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? O(n) or maybe O(n^2) because of recursion

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? assuming that n is the number of elements in both lists then worst case would be that when comparing them and adding them to a new list of duplicates would be half of the the total elements ie if all the names in each list aret the same. O(n/2) or O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n)
