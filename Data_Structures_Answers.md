Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) it has to check every node in the tree

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   I think it would be O(logN) because only half of the tree is being searched at a time

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n^2) it has to go through each item in the list twice

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n)

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n)

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n)
