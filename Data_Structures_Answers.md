Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
O(n) because it has to go through every node once

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
O(log n) since it is checking only halft of the tree at anytime
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(n) because it has to go through every node once
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
O(log n) beacause it only look at one level at a time

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n^2) since it has to check every name with every name
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n) only going though at list
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n)
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n)
