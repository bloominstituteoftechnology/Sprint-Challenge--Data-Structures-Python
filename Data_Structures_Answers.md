Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

   > This is O(1). Ring buffers must have a fixed length size at all times.

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

   > This is also true here O(1) it only overwrites the oldest

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

   > Again The ring buffers get method still will be an O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

   > Because of using a loop this complexity will be O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
