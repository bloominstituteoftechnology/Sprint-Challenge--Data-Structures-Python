Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
0(1) since there are no loops

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
0(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
0(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
0(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n^2) 

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n^2) because of the nested for loop

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
0(n) because of the for loop

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
0(n)
