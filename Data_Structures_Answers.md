Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? **O(n) because it's recursive.**

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
**On(n)**
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? **O(n^2) because there are two for loops calling 'n'.**

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? **O(n)**

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? **O(min(len(s), len(t))**
