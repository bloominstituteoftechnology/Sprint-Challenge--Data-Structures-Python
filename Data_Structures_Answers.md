Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

O(n^2). In the nested loop, the code is executed n times for n number of elements.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

The amount of memory used by this code is most likely proportional to the size of the input. O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

I have a for loop and a list comprehension in the code which is O(2n) or O(n).

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

O(5n) since I'm storing data in lists and a dictionary for a total of 5 times.
