Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

__Answer__: `O(n)` because we visit each node in the tree at least once.
____
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

__Answer__: `O(n)` because our Stack will require increasing size based on the amount of nodes in the tree - `n`.
____
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? 

__Answer__: `O(n)` because we visit each node in the tree once.
____
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? 

__Answer__: `O(n)` because `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree.
____

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? 

__Answer__: `O(n^2)`
____

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

__Answer__: `O(n)` because the max additional space required is dependent on `n`
