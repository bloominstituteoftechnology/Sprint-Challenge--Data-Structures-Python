Add your answers to the questions below.

`cb(self.value)` is O(1) since it only takes the passed in values and append it to an array.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

   - O(log n) because I used recursion to traverse on each branches of the tree and the height of the tree is based on log n.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

   - O(log n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
