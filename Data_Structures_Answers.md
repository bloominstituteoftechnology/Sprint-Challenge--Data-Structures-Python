Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n)
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) because we utilize a queue

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n^2)
6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n) because we create a duplicates list
7) What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) because we loop through and check the keys between the 2 dicts
8) What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(2n) because we make two dicts with key value pairs that are copies of name_1 and name_2
