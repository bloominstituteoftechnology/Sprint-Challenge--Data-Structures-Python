Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) Has to go through every node in tree

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   O(1) No new items are added

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) Has to go through every node

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) Because we add each node to a queue

5) What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(n^2) Two for loops that run n times with one nested inside the other

6) What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
   O(1) Not adding any new items

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) Two for loops that run n times, but the are not nested.

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
   O(n) We are adding a dictionary to keep track of names
