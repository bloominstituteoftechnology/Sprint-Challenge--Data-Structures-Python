Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n) since every node could be explored in worst case

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(1)


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n^2) because nest for loop

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? make it not a for loop to reduce it to O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? same
