Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
- O(n) because it has to go through all the items
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
- O(1) because no nothing new is created
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
- O (n) because it has to go through all the items
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
- O(n) because everything is added to a deque except the first node
5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
- O(n^2) because there is a nested loop
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(1) because it's only stored 1 place
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n) because I used a dictionary with all the names
