Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    O(n) because it has to go to each node

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
    O(n)



5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n^2) as it has two nested loops and loops through the entire list for each element in names_1

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n) because it stores all the names in two lists

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n) because it has to loop through all the names to store in data structure. Checking to see if a name exists happens in constant time because of the dictionary and so the runtime complexity is O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n) because it stores all the names in a list and dictionary
